# GBS_binning

GBS binning can impute genetic data based on recombination information of progeny genome

Input: 
      1. Genetic marker data
         It should be converted into A, H, or B based on the parental information
      2. Expected recombination frequency
      
Output: 
      1. Imputed genetic markers
      2. Mean recombination counts based on the imputation
